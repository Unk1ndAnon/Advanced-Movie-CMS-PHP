1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:06,105
- My name is barry allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,806
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,241
Killed by something impossible.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,542
- Run, barry, run!

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,112
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:17,182
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,450
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,818
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,621
But secretly I use my speed
to fight crime

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,123
And find others like me,

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,792
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,461
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,064
I am the flash.

14
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,833
Previously, on<i> the flash</i>
<i>and arrow...</i>

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,368
I'm just not sure I'm like you,
oliver.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,138
I don't know
if I can be some vigilante.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,807
- You can be better,
because you can inspire people

18
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,342
In a way that I never could.

19
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,511
- You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

20
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,079
To someone you care about.

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,314
How would he feel if doing that
put you in harm's way?

22
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,183
- You're giving hope
to a lot of people.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,052
So I'm doing this for them.
- Barry, when you met me,

24
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:56,622
Oliver, and dig, we were this
well-oiled archery machine,

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,123
But it didn't
start out that way.

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,958
- I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you tonight.

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,795
You're worth being on time for.

28
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,967
Everyone on this planet,
at some point in their lives,

29
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,136
Has had a major case
of the feels--

30
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,138
Those days when your heart
is just too small

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,543
To hold the big things
you're feeling.

32
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,179
Today's one of those days.

33
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,215
We think of our emotions like
they're these unique,

34
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,050
Personal phenomena,

35
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:28,454
That no one has ever felt
what we have felt.

36
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:32,024
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel--

37
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,725
Anger, love.

38
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,328
As a scientist,
I know there's nothing magical

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,598
About what makes us feel
something for someone else...

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,801
But then I see her smile.

41
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,504
Man, that cannot be science.

42
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,108
- ♪ whoo, I want it, whoo ♪

43
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,715
- Oh, and there's a fresh bottle
in the fridge

44
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,118
When she wakes up from her nap.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,953
Thank you.

46
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,191
- Sir?
Help you with something?

47
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,660
- Thanks.

48
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,096
I'll be just fine on my own.

49
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,811
- Sir, you're not allowed
to be back here.

50
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,880
- Nothing to get upset about.

51
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:32,651
[crowd commotion
in background]

52
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,195
- Barry, bank robbery
in progress

53
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,831
At cunningham and sampere.
- I got it.

54
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,199
- Wait, that's where I bank.

55
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,702
- Once super thieves showed up,
I went mattress.

56
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,404
[gunshot]

57
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,129
[gun clatters]

58
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,238
- I've already missed the gym.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,142
- Ugh, no.
Five more minutes.

60
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,811
Come on,
we never get to sleep in.

61
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,981
- I know.
But your dad hates tardiness.

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,219
Buzzkill.

63
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,188
- The buzziest.

64
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,296
Another picture of the flash
came in.

65
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,431
See?

66
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,133
- That red blur?

67
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,535
How do you know that wasn't
photoshopped?

68
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,803
- It wasn't.

69
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,373
It's not a hoax
or a mass hallucination.

70
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,410
You know, every day, someone new
accepts the impossible

71
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,446
And believes in him.

72
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,047
Why can't you?

73
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,484
- I believe in what I can see...

74
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,686
What I can touch...

75
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,689
What I can feel.

76
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,093
Which means I believe in you.
- Mm.

77
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,633
- Do you mind?
Thanks, man.

78
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,801
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

79
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,670
Witnesses reported
seeing a red streak?

80
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,972
- Joe, you should have seen it.
It was like everybody in here

81
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,974
Was trying to kill each other.
I got here just in time.

82
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,676
- Well, it must've
been a diversion,

83
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,312
Because there's 1/2 million
bucks missing from the vault.

84
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,080
There's a tracer
in the cash stacks.

85
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,649
We're trying to find the signal.

86
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:48,053
Meantime, any idea what could've
caused such mass...

87
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,455
This?
- A neurotoxin, maybe.

88
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,858
I'm going to swab some surfaces,
see what I can find,

89
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,061
But I think maybe
they got whammied.

90
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,298
- Did you just say "whammied"?
- I got so angry.

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,934
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

92
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,305
You have to believe me.
- I do.

93
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,206
Something is happening
in this city

94
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,208
And everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is,

95
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,311
And I think we should do
something about it.

96
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,479
- My boyfriend has decided
we need to eat healthy at home,

97
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,750
So work is now the only place
I can eat what I like.

98
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying
something, detective?

99
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,323
- The blur, the flash,
the man in the red suit--

100
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,325
Whatever he's called--
he was spotted at the bank

101
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,293
This morning.
- You mean the bank

102
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,329
That was robbed
of 1/2 million dollars,

103
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,564
Where a dozen people tried
to murder each other,

104
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,533
And you think our attention
should be focused on

105
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,202
Catching santa claus.
- I can't explain

106
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,138
How he gets to and from
crime scenes so fast.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,076
We need to figure out who this
guy is and what he wants.

108
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,011
- You should
ask your girlfriend.

109
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,781
She writes fan fiction
about him.

110
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,417
- Joe, help me out here.

111
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,685
- Sorry, partner.

112
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,621
I stopped believing in santa
when I was about eight.

113
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:01,059
[muffled arguing]

114
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,296
- Hey.
What's going on in there?

115
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,898
- I think eddie's trying
to convince the captain

116
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,301
That the flash
is a public menace.

117
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,802
- Excuse me?

118
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,404
[door opens]

119
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,606
- So after weeks of my trying
to convince you

120
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,241
That the flash is real,

121
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,876
Now that you finally
do believe me,

122
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,378
You're trying
to have him arrested?

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,712
What the hell?
- Thanks, barry.

124
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,047
- Sorry.

125
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,083
- No worries.
The captain shot me down.

126
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,785
Look, I'm not feeling
like lunch.

127
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,387
See you later.

128
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,792
- He's just jealous.

129
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,627
- Of the flash?

130
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,828
Should he be?

131
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,131
- No.

132
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,267
I'll see you later.

133
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,335
- Barry,

134
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,170
You need to get
to s.T.A.R. Labs.

135
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,440
- Yeah, I will.
After I eat.

136
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,517
- Anger, hate, aggression.

137
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,154
- [as yoda]
a jedi craves not these things.

138
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,755
No one is feeling that quote?

139
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,924
- Everyone in the bank
went total savage for,

140
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,292
Like, five minutes.

141
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,593
And then they were fine again.

142
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,729
- Anger can be
a powerful emotion.

143
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,365
If this meta-human can engender
irrational feelings of anger

144
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,434
In his victims,
he can do a lot of damage.

145
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,469
- Detective west helped get
a copy of the cat scans

146
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,771
The hospital did on everyone
at the bank.

147
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,207
Take a look.

148
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,508
- Well, look at this,

149
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,143
The emotion centers
of the brains

150
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,479
Are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

151
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,615
- Particularly the area that
controls executive function.

152
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,717
That's the part of the brain
that stops people from doing

153
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,753
Whatever random and potentially
destructive thing

154
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,121
That pops into their head.

155
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,622
- How do you think the meta
does it to them?

156
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,825
- That's the 1/2 million dollar
question.

157
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,260
[phone vibrates]

158
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,630
- Hey, if you guys figure it
out, just give me a call, okay?

159
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,700
- Is the flash off to another
rooftop rendezvous with iris?

160
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,702
- No.

161
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,972
Yeah, but she probably just
wants to ask me--

162
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,175
I mean, you know, him--about
meta-human stuff for her blog.

163
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,844
- Do you want some advice?

164
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,046
- No matter what I say,
I'm getting the advice, right?

165
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,247
- Don't get involved.

166
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,616
As the flash or yourself.

167
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,286
You don't want to be the one
to blame for their breakup.

168
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,489
- Okay.
I hear you.

169
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,764
[whoosh]

170
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,300
Iris.
- Flash.

171
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,938
Be great to call you
by your real name.

172
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,641
- You mean like ralph?

173
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,610
- Is your name ralph?

174
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,748
- What did you want
to see me about?

175
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,283
- My boyfriend, he's--

176
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,918
- Did you guys break up?

177
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,721
- No.
- Oh.

178
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,125
- He's a cop and he thinks
that you're dangerous.

179
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,427
And he's trying to convince
his boss that you're a menace

180
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,096
That needs to be stopped.

181
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,833
I thought I should warn you.

182
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,236
Anyways, you should probably go.

183
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,041
You're not going.

184
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,376
- [over radio]
barry, are you there?

185
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,777
- What?
- The police got a ping

186
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,579
From the tracer hidden
in the stolen cash.

187
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,215
Swat team's closing in
on the 1600 block of pass.

188
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,852
- Now stop ruining
iris' love life and go.

189
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,021
- I've gotta run.

190
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,324
- I bet you say that
to all the girls.

191
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,760
- What other girls?

192
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,846
- He always paid in cash.

193
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,349
Never seemed like trouble.
- He's on the move.

194
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,387
- Freeze!
- Hold it right there!

195
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,592
- Hands up.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

196
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,793
- Certo.

197
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,332
Turn around!

198
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,938
Certo, what are you waiting for?
Cuff him!

199
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,507
- You don't tell me what to do.

200
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,408
[gun cocks]

201
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,577
- Get down!
[gunshot]

202
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,257
Ugh!
Ah!

203
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,829
- Nice mask.

204
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,679
- It's kinda comforting to know
that no matter

205
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,614
What city you go to,
big belly burger is always

206
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,617
Going to taste
like big belly burger.

207
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,353
- You mean full of grease
and salt?

208
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,555
- I thought those were
the secret ingredients.

209
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,390
[engine revving]

210
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,825
Oliver's back.

211
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,097
- By the way, I gave oliver,
like, 1/2 hour head start.

212
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,134
- Hi, barry.
- Hey, felicity.

213
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,803
How you doing, dig?

214
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,738
- You're fast.

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,240
- Did you guys not tell him
about me?

216
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,209
- Seeing is believing, or...

217
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,178
Drooling.
[both chuckle]

218
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,814
[engine revving]

219
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,322
- Hey, thanks for showing up
back there, but I had that.

220
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,391
- Uh-huh.
- What, I was getting ready

221
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,460
To make my move.
- What move?

222
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,862
The one to the morgue?
- Wait, so what are you guys

223
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,799
Doing in central city?
- Working a case.

224
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:45,036
Suspicious homicide in the
styling where the murder weapon

225
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,905
Is a boomerang.

226
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,942
- Cool.

227
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,510
I mean, awful.

228
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,479
- I found traces
of iron oxide on it.

229
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,047
I know it's a long shot,
but central city has

230
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,283
The highest concentration of
iron oxide in the country.

231
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,684
- Did you know australian
aboriginals

232
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,352
Use boomerangs to hunt?
Mainly on kangaroo,

233
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,455
Which is a surprisingly
low-fat source of prot--

234
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,156
- [clears throat]
we were following up a lead

235
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,392
When we heard the s.W.A.T. Raid
over the radio, and I thought

236
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,262
That I would come by...
Watch you make your move.

237
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,331
- I had a cousin got hit
by lightning once.

238
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,433
He just developed a stutter.

239
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,935
- Huh.
Well, my team and I

240
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,004
Are after a nasty meta-human
who makes people angry.

241
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,206
- Cool.
- [laughs]

242
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,941
- I mean, awful.

243
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,843
- Uh, well, since you guys
are here, why don't we team up?

244
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,611
I'll help you find your
boomerang man, you can help me

245
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,346
Find my super rage-a-holic.
- We'd love to.

246
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,515
- No, we'll handle our business
and head home.

247
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,117
- The fastest way to find out
everything we need to know

248
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,852
About the boomerang is to sic
s.T.A.R. Labs on it.

249
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,054
- Enough people know
my secret identity.

250
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,823
- Fine--I'll go.
They already know who I am.

251
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,627
You can drop me off, and I will
meet up with you later.

252
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,562
- How 'bout I give you a lift?
- Whoo!

253
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,202
- Man,
that's not freaking you out?

254
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,972
- Let's go.

255
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,445
- Oh!
- So what'd you think?

256
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,679
- I think...

257
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,481
My shirt's on fire!
[sizzling]

258
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,917
- Oh, I'm sorry!

259
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,525
I'm glad I decided
not to go braless.

260
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,126
- You guys remember felicity?

261
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,362
- I'll always remember this.

262
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,430
- Hi, felicity,
it's so good to see you.

263
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,966
What brings you
back to central city?

264
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,101
Not barry?

265
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,502
- No, not barry.

266
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,905
This?
Not happening.

267
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,407
We looked down that road
and we said "no, thank you."

268
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,509
- They get it.

269
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:35,246
- Actually, I'm here...
Because of this.

270
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,048
- [gasps]
awesome!

271
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,583
What are the wings made of?

272
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,485
- Not sure--I'm thinking
some sort of composite

273
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,020
Or high-density plastic--

274
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,122
- Reinforced with carbon fiber.
Oh, that's weird.

275
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,124
It almost feels like it's--
- vibrating.

276
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

277
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,194
Oh, I wanna run some tests,

278
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,496
And I wanna run 'em right now!
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,099
- Hey, you guys come up
with anything new on our meta?

280
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,001
- The officer who was affected
tonight says he saw

281
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,637
A flash of red
before he lost control.

282
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,374
I suspect the meta is inducing
rage via the ocular nerve.

283
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,110
Oh, dr. Wells
wants to see you.

284
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,750
- Why do I feel like
I just got called

285
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,953
Into the principal's office?

286
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,956
- Starling city vigilante.

287
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,091
- He calls himself
"the arrow" now.

288
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,427
- Oh, does he...
"flash"?

289
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,395
- Wait, what's the problem?

290
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,564
- We don't trust him.

291
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,633
- You guys don't even know him.

292
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,201
- I know that he was wanted
for murder

293
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,837
In at least 12 different cases
dating back three years.

294
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,939
- I know there's been at least
two major terrorist attacks

295
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,075
In starling
since he became active.

296
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,509
- All right, but the cops there
are cool with him now.

297
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,811
He doesn't kill people anymore.

298
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,679
- And what about
all the criminals

299
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,715
That he put arrows through?
Those, what, don't count?

300
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,452
- He's a hero, joe.
- You're a hero, barry.

301
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,121
You offer protection,
hope, light.

302
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,858
What that man does is carry out
a dark reckoning for his city.

303
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,461
It is a brutal, violent vision
of justice,

304
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,396
One we do not share.
You truly think

305
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,964
He's a hero,
fine, so be it.

306
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,635
But he's not the kind
you should be looking up to.

307
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,270
[glass shatters,
loud clatter]

308
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,172
- Aah!

309
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,181
- That's my bad.
That's on me.

310
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,650
[crash, shatter]

311
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,221
- I want that "arrow"
out of my city.

312
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,123
Tonight.

313
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,861
- Tell me, do you think he can
do everything really fast?

314
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,829
I mean, like, how fast do you
think he goes to the bathroom

315
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,798
After he's eaten something?

316
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,867
- This is you watching my back?

317
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,771
- Well, the mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

318
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,073
- Whatever he can do now,
he's still the same barry

319
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,775
We met last year.
- Well, if you're so adamant

320
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,010
Against teaming up with him,
what are we doing here?

321
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,080
- He's a good kid,
and it's just a name, diggle.

322
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,017
The man who rents
this storage unit--

323
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,554
I want...His...Name.

324
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,262
- Hey.

325
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,864
- The bad guy that you're after,
the one who robbed the bank,

326
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,833
His name is roy g. Bivolo.

327
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,869
- Uh, thanks.
How did you find that out?

328
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,174
The guy's still alive, right?

329
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,542
I'm just asking.

330
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,143
I thought you
didn't want to help.

331
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,880
- I'm not.
It's just a name.

332
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,215
- All right.
- Hi.

333
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,650
- Hey.
- Ooh!

334
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,386
- One non-fat latte,
extra sugar for felicity,

335
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,990
And one coffee, black,
for oliver.

336
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,158
I brewed you a fresh pot,
so...

337
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,228
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

338
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,465
Barry, um, can I talk to you
for a second?

339
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,433
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

340
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,801
- Bye.

341
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,406
- Ow.
What are you doing?

342
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,609
- You did not tell me
that you knew oliver queen.

343
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,910
- I know oliver queen.
- Oh, my god,

344
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,512
He's even more handsome
in person.

345
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,681
And his arms are, like,
twice the size of yours.

346
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,783
- Technically
they're not twice the size.

347
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,151
- He's on my three list.

348
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,886
- What's a three list?
- My list

349
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,788
Of three guys I'm allowed
to cheat on eddie with.

350
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,490
You usually don't meet people
on your list,

351
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:10,261
But now here he is, and I just
cannot stop staring at him.

352
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,963
[sighs]

353
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,799
- Felicity,
this is me noticing you staring.

354
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,001
- We need to help barry
with his case.

355
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,703
Why don't you want to help?

356
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,605
- Because barry doesn't
really want my help.

357
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,340
He only thinks he does.

358
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,043
- Harrison wells
and barry's cop foster dad

359
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,112
Both said you were dangerous
and a bad influence.

360
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,782
Barry defended you.

361
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,350
- You're going to hock me
about this

362
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,053
Until I say yes, aren't you?

363
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,022
- I'm a hocker.

364
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,827
- Okay.

365
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,861
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we'll help you

366
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,163
Catch your bad guy.

367
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,731
- Great.
Meta-human.

368
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,233
- I am not calling him that,
barry.

369
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,137
- Partners?

370
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,173
- Partners.

371
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,887
- Hey.
- You're late.

372
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,956
Barry, how can you have
super-speed

373
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,292
And still not be on time?
- Sorry, I guess

374
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,528
The super-tardiness kinda
neutralizes it.

375
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,164
So how do we catch bivolo here?

376
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,367
- Oh, no, we don't here.
We're here to train.

377
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,303
- What?
Like<i> rocky?</i>

378
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,474
- I read your friend iris'
blog post on the flash,

379
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,777
And I visited all
the crime scenes you fought at.

380
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,145
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month

381
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,280
You took on a man
named leonard snart.

382
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,682
- We call him captain cold.

383
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,217
- We can talk about you giving
your enemies

384
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,952
Silly code names later.

385
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,122
- You mean like over coffee with
deathstroke and the huntress?

386
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,291
- The point is that you engaged
snart on a commuter train,

387
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,960
Which he derailed.

388
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,029
- Okay, there may have been some
damage, but I got the job done,

389
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,998
I was the hero.
- Barry, when you approach

390
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,668
A new environment, do you case
every inch of it?

391
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,606
You could.
You have the time.

392
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,475
But you don't.

393
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,444
You just run in blind.

394
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,947
There's a difference, barry,
between having powers

395
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,582
And having precision.

396
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,650
- When I came to you
thinking about

397
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,851
Going out and helping people,

398
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,586
You said
I could be an inspiration.

399
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,188
- Living this life...

400
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,223
Well,
it takes more than a mask.

401
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,791
It takes discipline.

402
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,294
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am--

403
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,364
- What is that for?

404
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,432
- You're going to run
over there,

405
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,001
You're going to come back at me,

406
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,202
And you're going to get hit
with an arrow.

407
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,172
- [laughs]
no, I'm not.

408
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,507
- [laughs]
yes, you are.

409
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,177
- Okay, fine,

410
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,945
I will humor you.

411
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,215
Ready?

412
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,286
- Ready.

413
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,157
- Nice try.

414
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,661
Gah!
Ah!

415
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,796
What, you shot me?
[panting]

416
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,598
- I heard you heal fast.

417
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
[squish]
- [screams]

418
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,935
Oh, god!

419
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,440
[muffled argument]

420
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,509
Hey.
What's up?

421
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,546
- Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

422
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,548
- But I thought the captain
shot him down already.

423
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,785
- Well, apparently
he's got a new argument.

424
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,554
The arrow made another
appearance last night.

425
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,457
And you forgot to tell me
that you got bivolo's name

426
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,793
From shooting that storage guy
in the leg.

427
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,561
- Well, technically
I didn't shoot him.

428
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,430
- Well, what word
would you use to describe

429
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,864
How you got this info?

430
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,835
I'm gonna go with "torture."

431
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,904
- I don't--the arrow
gets results.

432
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,505
- He's a crazy man.

433
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,908
- Look, I don't actually
disagree with you at the moment,

434
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,209
But we wouldn't even have
bivolo's name

435
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,044
If it weren't for the arrow.

436
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,147
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

437
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,250
- Two things I won't be doing
in this life--

438
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,854
Playing professional baseball,
and thanking that lunatic.

439
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,156
[beep]

440
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,891
- Stay.

441
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,426
- Have you heard
of color psychology?

442
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,861
- The theory that changes
in the color spectrum

443
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,329
Can affect emotion.

444
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,698
- It is so nice to have
another woman to talk to.

445
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,033
- I know.

446
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,635
- I was thinking
that if bivolo uses color

447
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,303
To induce the temporary
psychosis,

448
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,405
Maybe we can use light and color
to reverse it.

449
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:18,309
- Miss smoak,
a word, if you please.

450
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,815
- Hey, what's up, doc?

451
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,751
Sorry, that was dumb.

452
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,586
Remember I went to m.I.T.

453
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,221
- Yes, you're smart.

454
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,324
Felicity, I like to surround my
team with known quantities.

455
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,859
That is because I find
the unknown

456
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,029
To be toxic, dangerous.

457
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,065
The arrow is unknown.

458
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,404
- I can assure you, dr. Wells,
he's not dangerous.

459
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,306
To us.

460
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,342
- Well, of that,
I have little doubt.

461
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,745
And yet, I find myself
with a conundrum.

462
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:59,950
How can I completely trust a man
when I don't even know his name?

463
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,053
And so, I was hoping,
miss smoak,

464
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,622
That you could help me
trust him.

465
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:08,292
Who is he under the hood?

466
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,829
- That is not my secret to tell,
dr. Wells.

467
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,805
- Of course.

468
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,041
I'll figure it out on my own.

469
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,644
[whoosh]

470
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,212
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,780
- How'd it go with oliver?

472
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,015
- You know, to be honest,
not exactly the partnership

473
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,383
I thought it would be.

474
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,819
- Oh, did he really do the thing
with the arrows?

475
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,320
- You knew
he was going to shoot me?

476
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,722
- Whoa, it is practically
impossible to tell

477
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,789
When oliver's making a joke.

478
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,624
- Hey, we just got a ping from

479
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,127
The facial recognition software
on bivolo, aka, prism.

480
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,029
- Since when do we have
facial recognition software?

481
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,597
- Happy chanukah.
- Where can I find him?

482
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,999
- Traffic cameras just caught
him entering a residence

483
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,968
At 168 jarvis.

484
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,603
- We should let the arrow know.

485
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,305
- I can handle this solo.
I've done it before.

486
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,973
- Barry, I really think
you need to wait--

487
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,276
- Felicity,
I don't need his help.

488
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,490
[rattling]

489
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:13,557
[clatters]

490
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,134
- I knew you'd be coming
for me.

491
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,636
I could see it in your eyes
at the bank.

492
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:29,140
When I turned those people
against each other,

493
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,976
It made you angry.

494
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,217
Have some real anger.

495
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,930
- No signs of macular damage.

496
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,566
Your retina and cornea
seem unaffected.

497
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,901
- I told you, I'm fine.

498
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,836
- You said bivolo whammied you.

499
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,405
No desire to go mma
on any of us?

500
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,440
- No.

501
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,875
Yeah, I mean,
something weird happened

502
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,911
With his eyes for a sec.
- Weird thing?

503
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,513
- Yeah, everything went red.

504
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,248
- You were right.

505
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,251
- Okay, next thing you know,
bivolo was gone.

506
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,120
Look, obviously his powers
didn't work on me, so...

507
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,556
- It was stupid for you
to go out there alone.

508
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,291
You take too many risks.

509
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,860
As fast as you are, that's going
to catch up with you.

510
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,328
- Caitlin, I'm not ronnie.

511
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,363
You gotta stop treating me
like I am.

512
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,436
- You're right.
You're not.

513
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,043
- What?

514
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,546
- You are such a lovable dummy.

515
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,648
[phone vibrating]

516
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,985
- It's oliver--he wants
to have another session.

517
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,988
- I'm sure he's not going
to shoot you again.

518
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,491
Maybe you should
wear body armor.

519
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,697
- Thinking of new ways
to embarrass me?

520
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,532
- I'm not trying
to embarrass you, barry,

521
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,935
But you went after bivolo
last night alone

522
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,403
And you lost him.

523
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,405
- And you've never
had a misstep?

524
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,074
- Course I've had missteps.

525
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:14,578
Barry, I have been living this
life for almost eight years,

526
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,748
Encountering things
that you can't even fathom,

527
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,217
And I am still alive.

528
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,655
Not because super-speed
kept me out of the ground.

529
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:28,526
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning,

530
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,228
Keep training,
keep getting smarter,

531
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,299
And until you get that,
despite your best intentions,

532
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,202
You will do more harm than good.

533
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,605
- I finally see it.

534
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,708
You're a little bit
jealous of me, aren't you?

535
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,913
A guy like you, handsome, rich,

536
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,648
Can have any girl he wants,

537
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,183
Jealousy's probably
a new emotion for you,

538
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,020
So you might be a little slow
to get what it is

539
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,588
That you're feeling.

540
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,424
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

541
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,294
So you can train, lift weights,

542
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:06,130
Climb that stupid barn
till your heart explodes,

543
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,199
But you'll never be
as fast as I am.

544
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,603
You'll never be what I am.

545
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,674
And that's gotta hurt
your rock-hard pride, ollie.

546
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,544
- I told felicity
you didn't want my help.

547
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,514
- Yeah. You're finally right
about something.

548
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,386
- Allen! Where are you
with the bivolo case?

549
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,921
- I'm working it.

550
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,556
- Care to be more specific?

551
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,925
Hey, how 'bout you answer me
when I ask you a question?

552
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,961
- Hey!
How 'bout you back off?

553
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,396
- Excuse me?

554
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,633
- Look, I work just as hard
as anyone in this building.

555
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,703
I don't need you constantly
berating me to do my job.

556
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,638
When it's done,
you will have it, all right?

557
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,108
- Sorry, captain.
He's having an allergic reaction

558
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,143
To some bad medication.

559
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,779
- You remind him
who answers to who.

560
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,617
- Have you lost your mind?

561
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,218
- I'm so sick of singh talking
to me like that.

562
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,653
- He's still our boss.

563
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,521
Now I know you're upset
about losing bivolo--

564
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,691
- Wait, wait...
You're just like him.

565
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,694
Like wells, and oliver,
and everyone else my whole life

566
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,396
That didn't think
I could get the job done.

567
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,932
Do you want to help me, joe?
You want to help me?

568
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,567
Get my dad out of prison.

569
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,035
You helped put him there,
didn't you?

570
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,471
- Barry, I need you
to calm down.

571
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,440
Why don't we both
take a ride to s.T.A.R. Labs?

572
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,175
- I'm calm!
Okay?

573
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,679
When I am not calm,
you'll know.

574
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,889
- Okay.
I'll call you back later.

575
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,324
That was the arrow.

576
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,893
He says barry
is acting strangely.

577
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,094
- Strangely, how?

578
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,530
- He's been whammied.

579
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,199
He was acting angry.
It was scary.

580
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,302
And his eyes...
They glowed.

581
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,905
- It's possible that his body
is fighting off the effect,

582
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,074
So it's hitting him slower.
- When it comes to rage,

583
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,442
That is not a good thing.

584
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,910
The longer you suppress
your emotions--

585
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,412
- The bigger the explosion.

586
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,081
- Considering what he can do,
how do we even stop him?

587
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,351
- A cold-gun would come in
real handy right about now.

588
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,420
- Hey.
- I'm just sayin'.

589
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:12,556
- None of us can stop barry.

590
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,959
Fortunately,
felicity knows someone who can.

591
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,630
I think you better call back
oliver queen.

592
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,800
We're gonna need
the arrow's help.

593
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,109
[announcer on radio]

594

[changing stations]

595
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,848
- Is this your way of telling me

596
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,983
That you want satellite radio
for christmas?

597
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,418
[turns radio off]

598
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,654
Look, I am not mad at you.

599
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,857
- Good, 'cause there's no reason
you should be.

600
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,128
- Eddie, both you and the flash
care about protecting this city.

601
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,030
You would both
give your lives for it.

602
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,199
You're more alike
than you think, okay?

603
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,335
He's not the bad guy.

604
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,305
- How do you know
so much about him, iris?

605
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,177
- He got in touch with me
after I started the blog,

606
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,014
And I've seen him
a couple times.

607
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,883
- A couple times?

608
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,785
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

609
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,420
- Well, given the fact
that I think he's a hero,

610
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,855
And you want to put him in jail,

611
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,656
Do you really need
to ask that question?

612
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,993
- How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

613
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,897
[tires screeching]

614
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,507
- I heard you've been looking
for me.

615
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,581
- All this time,
you've been trying to catch me,

616
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,818
And I caught you first.

617
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,220
Guess you haven't read
your girlfriend's blog.

618
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,388
- Eddie, no!

619
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,557
[gunshots]

620
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,798
- Ooh, see I knew the arrow
was oliver queen.

621
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,467
I mean, I had it narrowed down
to, like, a list of 150 people,

622
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,170
But he was definitely
on that list.

623
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,906
- Do you have a way to stop
barry's rage-fest?

624
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,574
- I have an idea
about how to do that.

625
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,743
Joe, we're gonna need
your help.

626
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,912
- We need to find him first
before he hurts somebody.

627
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,647
- I have him.

628
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,217
Facial recognition picked him up
on a traffic camera downtown.

629
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,652
Oh, god.

630
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,358
- Eddie!

631
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,194
- Who the hell are you, huh?

632
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,562
You think
you can just come along

633
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,597
And get to have
whatever you want?

634
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,465
What gives you the right?

635
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,034
- What the hell
are you talking about?

636
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:40,070
- What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

637
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,271
- I feel fine.

638
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,873
- You are not fine.

639
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,509
- How would you know?
Because you write about me?

640
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,111
You don't know me!

641
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,047
You don't know who I am.

642
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,249
You never did.
- I know that you have

643
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,818
Risked your life
to help people,

644
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,854
To save them!
Someone who does that

645
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,357
Does not suddenly turn around
and want to hurt people.

646
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,893
Please.

647
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,502
- Run!

648
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,438
- Eddie, run!

649
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,209
- You need to calm down.

650
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,812
- And you need to hold on.

651
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,086
- I just hope
they can turn barry back

652
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,587
Before he kills oliver.

653
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,788
- Me, I'd be more worried
about what oliver

654
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,523
Might have to do to barry.

655
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,759
- Barry has superpowers.
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

656
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,427
- Do you have any idea
how many people

657
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,663
Oliver has killed
with that bow and arrow?

658
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,266
- Recurve bow arrows can travel
up to 300 feet per second,

659
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,600
So, like, 200 miles an hour.

660
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,135
Barry can run three times
that fast.

661
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,770
- Whatever.
Oliver's been doing this

662
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,705
A lot longer.
My money's on experience.

663
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,007
- My money's on speed.

664
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,508
- Please tell me
you're not actually

665
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,110
Having this conversation
right now.

666
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,449
- You missed.

667
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,084
- No.

00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,920

We're not done!

677
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,685

00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,790
