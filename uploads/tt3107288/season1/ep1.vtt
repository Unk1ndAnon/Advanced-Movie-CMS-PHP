1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,102
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:05,938
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed</i>

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,975
-<i> by something impossible.</i>
- Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,978
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,116
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,651
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,621
<i>but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime</i>

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,623
<i>and find others like me.</i>

10
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,825
<i>And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother...</i>

11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,495
- Mom!
- <i>And get justice for my father.</i>

12
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:32,531
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,299
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,002
You opened your lab after
Nora Allen's murder.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,604
Do you mind telling me what
you were doing

16
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,872
in Central City before that?

17
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,440
Here I thought we were
just two guys

18
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,376
having a friendly drink.

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,878
What?

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,279
I just noticed you don't
smile too much.

21
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,014
The explosion that put you
in a coma

22
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,183
also killed my fiancée.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,151
Ronnie!

24
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,452
He was a hero.

25
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,953
I didn't want him to be
a hero.

26
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,756
I wanted him to be my husband.

27
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,992
Don't look for me again.

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,497
Everyone has a hero,

29
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,566
someone they look up to
or admire,

30
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,870
someone they just wish
they could be.

31
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,939
It's easy to believe in heroes.

32
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,042
What's hard is when our heroes
stop believing in us.

33
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,845
Barry, there's an
intersection coming up. Hurry!

34
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,047
This should slow 'em down.

35
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,323
Guys, which way?

36
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,357
- Left.
- Right.

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,425
- Right.
- Left.

38
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,726
Stop! You both hear you're

39
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,095
telling me two different things,
right?

40
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,163
Barry, listen up.
Listen carefully.

41
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,698
Here is what you're going to do.

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Now, the Queen is trying to make
it to the bridge,

43
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,235
but I have a shortcut...
wait for it...

44
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,938
And left... left...

45
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,406
right...
I see her!

46
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,874
Make her go west
before Fremont.

47
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,576
- Okay, how?
- I'd recommend a detour.

48
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,851
Now, the King is headed for
the entrance to the interstate.

49
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,719
What entrance?

50
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,855
Atta boy.

51
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,726
Check...

52
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,896
Got the keys.

53
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,331
Mate.

54
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,503
Give me some!

55
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,570
Yeah!

56
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,106
Efficiently done, Mr. Allen.

57
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,642
- We need a picture.
- Pretty sure rule number one

58
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,278
of having a secret identity is
not taking pictures of yourself

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,746
in your super suit
without a mask on.

60
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,515
Come on, please!

61
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,850
This is just for us.
This is to document all this.

62
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,385
Who knows? Maybe people
in the future

63
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,220
will want to know how
all this happened.

64
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,755
All right, well, if you want
the future to have

65
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,424
the whole story, then,
we all need to be in it.

66
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,226
First, let me put on
some makeup?

67
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,988
The future does not care
about your makeup.

68
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,298
Okay.

69
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,733
Big smiles.

70
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,502
Three... two... one.

71
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,306
Does that count as a selfie?

72
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,908
Absolutely.

73
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,677
Sick.
Came out good.

74
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,013
Thanks for talking me through
things out there.

75
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,181
My pleasure.

76
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,849
Well done.

77
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,118
I have to say it was a bit
of a rush feeling like a...

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,453
- A hero.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,422
You're pretty good at it.

80
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,465
You do realize the whole point
of moving out is

81
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,034
not being at home anymore,
right?

82
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,804
I forgot a few things.

83
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,507
So... how is it living back
at the house?

84
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,876
- Bar?
- Yo.

85
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,712
Babe...
spaghetti a la me.

86
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,980
You sure you don't want
to stay for dinner?

87
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,516
Thanks, but Eddie is painting
all day

88
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,384
and I swore that I would help.

89
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,552
Although, I'm really just going
to do that thing

90
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,620
where I get a little paint

91
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,662
on my hair and on my nose.

92
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,192
Someone from Central City
Picture News called you

93
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,860
the other day... I left the number
on the fridge.

94
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,028
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,797
Chill! Just did.

96
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,668
I heard that some members
of the Royal Flush Gang

97
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,971
are headed to prison.

98
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,139
Is that a good scream or
a bad scream?

99
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,908
Good! So good!

100
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,110
I just got offered a job
as a reporter

101
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,112
at Central City Picture News.

102
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,448
- That's awesome!
- The editor's a fan of my blog!

103
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,718
- That is amazing.
- My God!

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,052
God.

105
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,801
Harrison Wells.

106
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,374
Hello?

107
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,044
We both know what you did.

108
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,791
It's time to pay the piper!

109
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,218
Come in.

110
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,324
Look, Joe, I apologize
for all of this.

111
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,327
It just... it really feels like a
case of so much for so little.

112
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,396
The police should not have
been called.

113
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,232
I got a prank call before
all this happened.

114
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,369
This feels like more than just
a prank, Doctor.

115
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,206
Well, there are those who feel
I did not suffer enough

116
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,341
for the particle accelerator
explosion of last year,

117
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,944
and some of them act on it.

118
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,048
Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells, are you okay?

119
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,617
Dr. Snow, I'm... I'm fine.
A little chilly.

120
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,419
Otherwise, I'm fine.
Hello, Cisco.

121
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,087
Make yourselves at home
as best you can.

122
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,890
I'm gonna make
a hotel reservation.

123
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,428
This place is so sick.

124
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,231
Yeah... what took you guys
so long?

125
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,732
We got lost.

126
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,868
We've never been here before.

127
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,369
Really? Never?

128
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,938
He tends to keep his
private life private.

129
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,916
A precipice in front,
and wolves behind.

130
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,385
In other words, you're between
a rock and a hard place.

131
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,755
Check.

132
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,293
The King is dead.

133
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,895
Checkmate.

134
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,634
Dr. Wells?

135
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,670
There he is.

136
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:23,074
Hartley, allow me to introduce
you to Cisco Ramon.

137
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,744
Mr. Ramon here is one of the
finest mechanical engineers

138
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,612
I have ever seen.

139
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,249
I can't believe Harrison Wells
said that about me.

140
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,351
I'm sure he'll prove to be an
invaluable member of your team.

141
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,654
Trust me.
You I trust.

142
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,889
I don't foresee myself
trusting someone

143
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,257
who showed up to his first day
of work

144
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,092
at a billion dollar
research facility

145
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,128
wearing a T-shirt that says.

146
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,965
"Keep Calm and Han Shot First."

147
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,768
Would you give us
a minute please, Cisco?

148
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,170
Yes, sir.

149
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,143
I realize you don't have to
explain your hiring decisions

150
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,646
to me, but maybe for the sake
of a fun exercise,

151
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,748
we could pretend you did.

152
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,051
I have a good feeling
about him.

153
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,652
Just as I did about you.

154
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,590
Hartley...

155
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,161
You're still my guy.

156
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:21,233
And nothing and no one is ever
going to change that.

157
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,505
I canvassed the street.

158
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,673
No other reports of vandalism.

159
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,376
No strange cars.

160
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,813
Get this... Wells says he's right
there when it happened.

161
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,550
All that glass shattering down
around him and he can't walk?

162
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,086
And he didn't have a scratch
on him.

163
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,144
There's no point of impact.

164
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,781
No rock or bat or...
any solid object

165
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,383
went through these windows.

166
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,853
It's as if they just
shattered themselves.

167
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,958
This wasn't some teenage prank?

168
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,094
No, it wasn't.

169
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,729
But you don't want our help.

170
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,032
Why?

171
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,802
Because I already know
who did this.

172
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,805
Hartley Rathaway.

173
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,808
Who is Hartley Rathaway?

174
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,611
Hartley Rathaway is
the prodigal son.

175
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,447
And he has returned.

176
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,755
Hartley Rathaway possesses one
of the finest scientific minds

177
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,557
I've ever encountered.

178
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,392
Any ties to
Rathaway Industries?

179
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,761
His grandfather founded the
company, his father expanded it,

180
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,930
and Hartley here was set
to inherit the throne.

181
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,733
- What happened?
- He came out to his parents.

182
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,468
Old money, old values.

183
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,136
They were estranged
when we met,

184
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,105
but, brilliant.
I couldn't have built

185
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,640
the particle accelerator
without him.

186
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,109
You guys have never even
mentioned his name.

187
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,613
That's because Hartley had
a challenging personality.

188
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,782
What she means is he was
mostly a jerk.

189
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,485
But, every once in a while,

190
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,720
he could be a dick.

191
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,590
Let's just say that Hartley,
like many outliers,

192
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,292
had trouble relating to
his peers.

193
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,894
Yes, but he was always
your favorite.

194
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,297
The chosen one.

195
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,032
He referred to himself
like that.

196
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:38,603
So if you two were so close,
why would he target you?

197
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,071
Hartley left S.T.A.R. Labs
about a year ago

198
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,707
after we had a...

199
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,576
a disagreement.

200
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,446
About what?

201
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,715
Look, don't worry.
We'll stop him.

202
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,885
I won't let him hurt you...
any of you.

203
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,955
Let's get back to my lab,
all right?

204
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,163
I could've gone my whole life
without seeing that jerk again.

205
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,703
Yo. This place is so dope.

206
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,772
What a coincidence.
We were thinking of making.

207
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,008
"Yo. This place is so dope"
our new slogan.

208
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,943
If you're so convinced
Dr. Wells made a mistake

209
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,048
in hiring me, why don't you try
proving it to him?

210
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,650
Magnetic flux is measured
by what?

211
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,185
Hall effect pick up.

212
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,521
The dual of a parallel
R-C circuit?

213
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,357
Series R-L circuit.
I can go all day, pal.

214
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,529
Hartley, it looks like you
have met your match.

215
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,198
I am Dr. Caitlin Snow.
It's very nice to meet you.

216
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Cisco Ramon.
Nice to meet you.

217
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,436
And just ignore Hartley.
We all do.

218
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,438
Tell your boyfriend I need his
specs on the synchotron

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,972
by end of day.

220
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,975
Actually, it is the end of
Ronnie's day.

221
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,377
We are leaving early.

222
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,978
My boyfriend is taking me
out of town

223
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,880
for our one-year anniversary.

224
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,016
- Aw. That's sweet.
- Thanks.

225
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,484
I'll see you guys on Monday.

226
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,519
See ya.

227
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,590
She seems nice.

228
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,325
You don't.

229
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,060
I give you a week.

230
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,429
Max.

231
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,112
Hi. I'm Iris West.
It's my first day.

232
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,747
I can see that.

233
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,515
Really? Does it show?

234
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,350
The fact that I've never
seen you before shows.

235
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,619
Mr. Bridge! Nice of you to
make an appearance

236
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,654
at a staff meeting.

237
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,023
I do love a good shmear.

238
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,527
Everyone, welcome Iris West,
our new cub.

239
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,663
Anyone want to volunteer to be
her mama bear?

240
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,834
Mason, you picked a bad day
to actually show up.

241
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,170
- I don't nanny.
- I lost the ability

242
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,506
to make a joke back in '05.
Today, you do.

243
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,375
Deadlines. All new stories
are due on my desk

244
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,877
at the end of the day.

245
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,579
Actually, I had an idea
for a piece.

246
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,414
There's this program in Keystone

247
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,350
that helps battered women get
back on their feet.

248
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,620
That sounds really great,
West.

249
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,922
Actually, any thoughts on
a piece about The Flash,

250
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,893
something you haven't written
about yet, something new?

251
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,795
No.

252
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,098
Not currently.

253
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,833
All right.
Sally forth, everyone.

254
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,535
Sally forth.

255
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,571
Everything has
a natural frequency.

256
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,273
And since sound is expressed

257
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,108
as a vibration, if the pitch
of the sound

258
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,610
matches the natural vibration
frequency of an object, then...

259
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,585
So, you're saying that can
happen to anything,

260
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,287
Not just glass?
Yeah.

261
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,589
I think that's absolutely what
happened to the windows

262
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,057
at Wells' house.

263
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,627
He's using some kind of
sonic technology.

264
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,631
I'm getting this feeling that
Wells is hiding something...

265
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,767
about what's going on with
this Rathaway character...

266
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,669
Don't touch that!

267
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,506
I mean, it sounds like this
Hartley guy was a pill

268
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,374
before he went all
super villain, so I...

269
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,176
I get why he never
mentioned him.

270
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,313
Like he never mentions his
girlfriend that got killed.

271
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,747
No.

272
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,649
How do you know about her?

273
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,751
He's taking up a big part
of our lives.

274
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,420
I wanted to know more about him.

275
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,455
I mean, if you want to know
more about him,

276
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,357
you could just ask me.

277
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,229
Sounds like you don't know him
as well as you think.

278
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,031
Joe. Multiple 911 calls.

279
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,234
Rathaway Industries
is under attack.

280
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,902
Sector cars are en route.

281
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,740
Barry, it's Caitlin.

282
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,042
I think I know why
you're calling.

283
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,194
Get down on the ground!

284
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,902
It's over, Rathaway.

285
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,137
You know my name.

286
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,373
I know some names too.

287
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,874
Caitlin Snow.

288
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,709
Cisco Ramon.

289
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,312
Harrison Wells.

290
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,981
I can hear the radio waves
emanating from your suit.

291
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,549
About 1900 megahertz.

292
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,052
Is that them on the other end,
listening?

293
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,554
Are they gonna hear you die?

294
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,190
No. They're going to hear you
get your ass kicked.

295
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,759
Okay.

296
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,277
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says.

297
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,445
Smart enough to have
figured out

298
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,280
who Harrison Wells really is.

299
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,450
You see, I know his secret.

300
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,529
Being scooped up by a guy clad
in head-to-toe leather

301
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:08,132
is a long-time fantasy of mine,
so thanks.

302
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,102
Well, well, well,
the gang's all here.

303
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,805
You've lasted a lot longer than
I would've thought, Cisco.

304
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,607
And you didn't last
ten seconds against The Flash.

305
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,876
I was thinking of calling
myself Pied Piper.

306
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,680
I assign the nicknames
around here.

307
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,550
Although that one's not bad.

308
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,151
Caitlin...

309
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,886
Never did get
that wedding invite.

310
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,421
Shut the hell up!

311
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,491
Stay in front of me.

312
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,701
The scanner is detecting foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

313
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,303
Take 'em out.
I can't.

314
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,005
I suffered head trauma when
S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

315
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,940
My hearing was severely damaged.

316
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,908
Without these, I'm in pain
you can't imagine.

317
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,613
We all lost something
that night.

318
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,285
Very clever re-purposing
the anti-proton cavities

319
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,854
into confinement cells.

320
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,756
Wells' idea, I'm sure.

321
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,424
It was mine, actually.

322
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,102
Hartley, don't make this more
difficult than it has to be.

323
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,009
Enough, Hartley.

324
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,781
Give us a minute.

325
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,684
See you soon, Cisco.

326
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,086
Doubt it!

327
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,166
God, I wish I'd taken
a language in high school.

328
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,501
How did you know we were
working with The Flash?

329
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,703
I wrote a hexagonal algorithm

330
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,105
tracking all of his sightings,

331
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,941
extrapolating a theoretical
exit trajectory.

332
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:01,279
In other words, every time he
ran from the scene of a crime,

333
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,315
he ran in this general
direction.

334
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,251
You are brilliant.

335
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,722
And... any anguish you have been
through because of me

336
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,493
was never my intent.

337
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,928
Not bad...

338
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,398
as far as
heartfelt apologies go.

339
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,568
Except that wasn't for
my benefit.

340
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,104
That was for you, Flash.

341
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,006
Feels good to have the great
Harrison Wells behind you,

342
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,409
doesn't it?
But one day,

343
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,346
this man will turn on you...

344
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,181
in a flash...

345
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,317
and even you won't
see it coming.

346
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,453
I only hope that he leaves you
in better shape than he left me.

347
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,623
If you're lucky,
you'll only be dead.

348
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,260
Because every day I have to live
with the agonizing,

349
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,896
piercing screaming in my ears.

350
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,735
I almost forgot...
I told your pet

351
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,305
I know your deep, dark secret,
Harrison.

352
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,542
Have fun letting him in
on that one.

353
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,016
I assume you were all
listening.

354
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,686
Well, Hartley was telling
the truth.

355
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,322
I have not been honest with you.

356
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,057
With any of you.

357
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,034
The accelerator...

358
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,136
Hartley warned me that there was
indeed a chance

359
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:35,139
that the accelerator
could explode.

360
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,845
His data did not show
100% certainty,

361
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,247
just that there was a risk,
but it was a real risk.

362
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,918
And yet I made the decision

363
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,890
that the reward... that...

364
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:56,561
everything we could learn and
everything we could achieve,

365
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,030
that all of that...

366
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,403
simply outweighed that risk.

367
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,638
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,477
Then the next time you choose
to put our lives,

369
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,247
and the lives of the people
that we love,

370
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,649
at risk,

371
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,719
I'll expect a heads up.

372
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:36,500
After the explosion,
when everyone else left you...

373
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:41,239
Caitlin and Cisco stood by you.

374
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,708
You owe them more than
an apology.

375
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,510
They might soon get more
than that what with Hartley

376
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,347
so intent on sending me
to the next world.

377
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,048
What are...

378
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,118
that wouldn't make it right
with them.

379
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,890
You broke their trust.
Our trust.

380
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,142
Hi, chief.

381
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,778
Is that what people call you?
No. Not really.

382
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,447
Listen, eyewitnesses say that
The Flash thwarted an attack

383
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,083
downtown today.
Look into it.

384
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,286
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

385
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,554
Mason, you're looking
particularly rumpled today.

386
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,127
So, what are we working on?

387
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:40,097
I am following up on a lead
on corruption at the DWP.

388
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,200
You... well, I think you just got
your assignment from Larkin,

389
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,636
didn't you?

390
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,204
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

391
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,706
I know that Larkin hired me
because he thinks

392
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,142
that I have some sort of in
with The Flash.

393
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,144
But I am serious about
being a journalist.

394
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,213
Why? Because you write a blog?

395
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,917
My mother writes a blog.

396
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,286
I may not have a lot of
experience, but I do have...

397
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,489
Spunk? Grit?

398
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,291
Gumption?

399
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,427
What is this,
a Chick-Lit novel?

400
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,339
No, no, no, I am having
the worst day ever.

401
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,542
We both can't be having
the worst day ever. Okay?

402
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,110
And I was really looking forward
to getting

403
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,678
some good complaining in.

404
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,480
Well, fire away.

405
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,683
Okay, well, turns out that
the real reason they hired me

406
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,685
is because they think I have
some sort of connection

407
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,154
to The Flash, which I don't.

408
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,856
Not anymore.

409
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,925
And I've been teamed up with
Mason Bridge,

410
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,695
who is a legend, who I admired,
before he told me

411
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,698
I was a worthless,
talentless millennial.

412
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,705
Well, the people we admire
aren't always

413
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,341
who we'd like them to be.

414
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,843
Well said.

415
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,214
So, I'm screwed.

416
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,683
No, look...

417
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:09,520
if this Mason guy doesn't see
what a talented journalist

418
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,489
you are, then he's probably
a lousy writer.

419
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,891
He won the Pulitzer.

420
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,360
Twice, I think.

421
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,262
Good for him.

422
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,167
Thanks, Barry.

423
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,737
Having someone believe in me,
it's...

424
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,807
a small... really,
really big thing.

425
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

426
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,087
Where's Dr. Wells?

427
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,257
I'm not sure.
Barry was right.

428
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,892
Hartley was using sonic
resonance.

429
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,227
The intensity regulator's
measuring decibels.

430
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,562
But you know what's weird?

431
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,198
He had it set to
the lowest setting.

432
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,033
- What do you mean?
- Well...

433
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,269
He could've completely destroyed
his father's building

434
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,104
if he wanted to in one blast.

435
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,339
So, why not just do it
and leave?

436
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:07,011
I mean, why stick around and run
the risk of getting caught?

437
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,146
Unless he wanted to be caught.

438
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,354
Dr. Wells!

439
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,123
There's been a pipeline breach.

440
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,991
Hartley.

441
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,795
Stay here.

442
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,476
Not now.

443
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,485
Cisco, can you hear me?

444
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,863
- What's up?
- Listen to me... Hartley escaped.

445
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,499
He's loose in the facility.
Okay.

446
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,471
Okay, your turn... why are you
having the worst day...

447
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,784
Tell me, Harrison.

448
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,786
Am I still your guy?

449
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,457
Are you okay?

450
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,594
Yeah, Cisco and Dr. Wells.

451
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,265
He's gone.

452
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,542
Welcome back, Mr. Ramon.

453
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:55,479
Man.

454
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,581
Caitlin?

455
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,049
She's fine.

456
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,051
You need to rest.
You have a concussion.

457
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,354
You're lucky.

458
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,189
Please tell me you got him.

459
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,325
I guess the attack on his
family's company was a fake out

460
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,693
so we'd catch him.
And give him

461
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,862
direct access to S.T.A.R. Labs.
Why?

462
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,931
I should've known he was
up to something.

463
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,165
This is my fault.

464
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,967
Man.
This is on me, too.

465
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,302
I shouldn't have left before...

466
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,471
This is no one's fault
but mine.

467
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,474
I earned the blame... I'm not
interested in sharing it.

468
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,177
Hartley doesn't think I've paid
for my crimes.

469
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,545
And he's right.

470
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,614
He won't stop until I do.

471
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,852
Where are you going?

472
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,887
To earn back your trust.

473
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,765
Now what were you doing
in my accelerator?

474
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,968
Thought it was
our accelerator.

475
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,038
Because it will be our fault
if we turn this thing on

476
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
and blow a hole in Central City.

477
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,446
You are wagering the lives
of everyone in this building.

478
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,348
Everyone in this city.

479
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,949
If you don't have the courage
to admit you could be wrong,

480
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,519
I will do it for you.

481
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,320
Hartley Rathaway...

482
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,592
your position at S.T.A.R. Labs
is terminated.

483
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,062
If you think you can
shut me up...

484
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,563
I know I can, Hartley.

485
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,399
Because if you breathe one word
of any kind of

486
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,234
unsubstantiated accusation,

487
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,570
I will make sure the only job
you ever get in physics

488
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,641
is teaching it to
high school juniors.

489
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,758
What is going on here?

490
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,294
Press conference.

491
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,167
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

492
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,037
And for those of you that read
the ten-volume report

493
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,339
issued by the Norris Commission,

494
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,608
well, I commend you on
your tenacity.

495
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,612
You already know, then,
the circumstances that led to

496
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:13,117
the explosion of the S.T.A.R.
Labs particle accelerator.

497
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,986
Or rather, you think you do.

498
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:20,090
Now, the Commission's finding
was that the catastrophe was

499
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,128
caused by a chain of events that
nobody could have predicted,

500
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,130
including myself.

501
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,664
The truth is...

502
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,233
I was warned there was a chance

503
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,669
the particle accelerator
might fail.

504
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,571
I was warned by
a former colleague...

505
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,940
a friend.

506
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,177
I chose to ignore the warning
and in so doing,

507
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,349
I let down all of you.

508
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,484
As a new friend pointed out...

509
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,687
I failed this city.

510
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:55,659
I failed this city and I failed
those who trusted me the most.

511
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,062
By coming forward today...

512
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,599
it's my hope I'm taking
the first step toward

513
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,401
regaining that trust.

514
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,238
And your trust as well.

515
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,843
Are there any questions?

516
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,178
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding

517
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,313
the particle accelerator?

518
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,319
Miss West, do you have
a question for me?

519
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,257
I don't believe you answered
my colleague's question,

520
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,159
Dr. Wells,
so I'll ask it again.

521
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,961
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding

522
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,330
the particle accelerator,
either now or in the future?

523
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,769
Of course not.

524
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,171
Thank you for your answer,
Doctor.

525
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,173
It's my pleasure.

526
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,875
No further questions.

527
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,314
What was that?

528
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,349
Gumption.

529
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,485
Has Hartley made contact yet?

530
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,120
What makes you so sure
he will?

531
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,589
Because he's Hartley,

532
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,390
and he'll want to have
the last word.

533
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,292
Cisco, you should be resting.

534
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,061
The answer to why Hartley
fooled us into catching him

535
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,230
is in here,
and I'm gonna find it.

536
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,742
- You have nothing to prove.
- Not true.

537
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,182
Do you know why I hired you,
Cisco?

538
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,718
You said you saw something
in me... I know.

539
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,220
What I saw was humanity.

540
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,990
You and Hartley, Cisco,
you're both brilliant.

541
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,193
You both have mental...

542
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,562
sparks.
But his brilliance

543
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,230
subtracted from the experience
of working here,

544
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,531
whereas your brilliance,

545
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,067
your heart,

546
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,803
your warmth, your humor,

547
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,305
it just adds to it.

548
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,413
There is no chosen one,
Cisco.

549
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,917
No second or third favorite.
Never was.

550
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,686
It's just us.

551
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,092
What's that?

552
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,895
Nice gambit, Harrison.
But this isn't over.

553
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,931
Hartley, what do you want?
What do you want, Hartley?

554
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,766
I already gave my mea culpa
today.

555
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,868
The city already hated you.

556
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,636
You don't think I noticed
that press conference

557
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,738
was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?

558
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,775
No, no, no. I've played with you
too many times

559
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,710
to let you get away with that.

560
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,880
This is between you, me,
and The Flash.

561
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,049
You don't want to play
for those kind

562
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,383
of stakes with me, Hartley.

563
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,119
Actually, I really do.

564
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,722
What do you say?
One last game of chess?

565
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,590
You and I both know that
the winner of the game

566
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,592
is the one who makes
the next-to-last mistake,

567
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,528
and you clearly have
a move in mind.

568
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,063
You're right.

569
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,398
And I'm already at the board.

570
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,469
So why don't you move your
precious scarlet knight...

571
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,342
While I take out a few pawns.

572
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,858
All right. All right, Cisco,
where do I go?

573
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,927
I can't trace the signal.
He could be sending his messages

574
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,528
from anywhere.
Cisco,

575
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,197
scan for seismic activity.

576
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,431
If Hartley's using sonic blast,

577
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,899
the vibrations could cause
tremors.

578
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,651
Look. Over here. Quake
activity but no fault line.

579
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,420
The Keystone Cleveland Dam.

580
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,591
Barry! Don't underestimate
him. He's brilliant.

581
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,995
Well, good thing I'll have you
in here.

582
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,036
Rook to knight four.

583
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,389
Barry, you need to disarm
Hartley immediately.

584
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,857
Immediately! Do you hear me?

585
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,426
He is a master of distraction.

586
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,995
He is a master of hiding his
true endgame.

587
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,009
"A" what?

588
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,777
I figured out what Hartley

589
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,746
stole from S.T.A.R. Labs,
why he let himself get caught.

590
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,614
Which brings us to
the "A".

591
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,184
He has all the data on
Barry's molecular scans.

592
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,852
Why would he want that?

593
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,387
He can get Barry's frequency.

594
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,189
Barry, you need to get out of
there!

595
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,157
You need to get out of there
immediately!

596
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,734
It's over! You lose!

597
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,938
Amazing.
He replaced me with you?

598
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,406
Total moron.

599
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:12,275
I got you with
the same trick twice.

600
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:22,352
I got the idea watching you
and Harrison chit-chat...

601
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,654
to use your suit's own speakers
to kill you.

602
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,726
That feeling? That's your
organs shearing apart.

603
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,897
And you activated the frequency
when you disarmed me.

604
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,833
In chess, we call that
a discovered attack.

605
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,836
You don't see it
until it's too late.

606
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,272
Right, Harrison?

607
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,441
Barry's vitals are
bottoming out.

608
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,076
We need to do something.

609
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,844
What are you doing?

610
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,013
Barry's on the travel road
of the dam, at rush hour,

611
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,748
surrounded by cars.

612
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,151
Many of those cars are going to
have satellite radio.

613
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,652
Satellite sends a signal to
the car,

614
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,187
song comes out the speaker...
Yes! I know

615
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,990
how satellite radio works!
How does that help?

616
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,590
Well, I'm gonna have the
satellite send something

617
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,825
other than a song.

618
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,660
Hartley is about to hear
something

619
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,061
he was not expecting...

620
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,663
a sound wave that will meet
the frequency of

621
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,798
and destroy his weapons.

622
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,239
You don't seem so special
anymore.

623
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,408
Given how easy it was to bring
you down,

624
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,077
I wonder if Harrison will
even miss you.

625
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,091
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no!

626
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:37,394
No!

627
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,809
Checkmate.

628
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,649
Barry, can you hear me?

629
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,952
Sort of!

630
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,698
- Okay!
- How do you feel?

631
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,267
Fine! I mean there is
a little ringing in my ears,

632
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,935
but other than that I'm good,
so...

633
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,971
You're speaking very loudly.

634
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,240
- Sorry.
- It's okay, it'll pass.

635
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,211
- Nice moves.
- Thank you.

636
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,746
Anytime.

637
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,648
I think I'm gonna take my
doctor's advice

638
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,749
and go lie down.

639
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,551
What a great idea!

640
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,755
Man, I feel like I'm hung over
times ten.

641
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,523
I'm not surprised.

642
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,198
It's difficult for me...

643
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,701
to admit when I'm wrong.

644
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,671
Certainly, in front of
an entire city but also...

645
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,043
Also to my closest friends.

646
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,216
So I hope one day

647
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:09,419
to restore your trust
and faith in me.

648
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,190
That day was today.

649
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,469
Not every hero wears a mask.

650
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,307
Some heroes save the day in
the simplest of ways.

651
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,343
By just being there for us...

652
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:36,313
or letting us know
we're believed in.

653
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:40,216
If I'm any sort of hero today,
it's not because of my speed.

654
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:45,288
It's because I learned how from
the people in my life...

655
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,624
all of them.

656
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,501
Man, that press conference today
was something else.

657
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,605
Dr. Wells...
took a lot of guts to do that.

658
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,207
I have to give him that.

659
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,544
He has his moments.

660
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,579
What's up?

661
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,381
Must have been hard for you.

662
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,583
What? To be this handsome?

663
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,185
Raising me.

664
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,520
No.

665
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,857
Well, a kid who loved
math and chemistry,

666
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,659
whose idea of
a fun afternoon was

667
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,661
doing experiments in the garage.

668
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,230
Couldn't have been easy.

669
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,899
As soon as I started AP classes,
you had

670
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,869
no clue how to help me
with my homework.

671
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,038
- No.
- You must have always felt like

672
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,910
you were competing with Richard
Dawkins and Neil Tyson and...

673
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,713
Henry Allen too.

674
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,015
But, look, none of them...
no one...

675
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,551
could ever replace you.

676
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,453
Not even Wells.

677
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,556
Aw.

678
00:39:58,497 --> 00:39:59,829
All right,
I'll see you at home.

679
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,664
All right.

680
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,733
- Eddie.
- Barry.

681
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,870
What'd you find out?

682
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:10,707
I searched Wells' entire house
like you said.

683
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,809
There was nothing.

684
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,045
Are you sure you want to
do this...

685
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,281
Investigate Wells?

686
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,616
100%

687
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:42,238
Your evil hearing aids won't
help you escape this time.

688
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,274
So I'd get comfy.

689
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,277
You must be enjoying this,
Cisco.

690
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,912
- I am.
- Well,

691
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,613
if that scares you,
I can't imagine

692
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,714
how you're gonna feel when you
open up these doors

693
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,416
and let me out of here.

694
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,286
Maybe I'm going deaf,
'cause I could've sworn

695
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,521
you just said I'm gonna
let you out.

696
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,824
And very soon too.

697
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,395
Why would I ever do that?

698
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:08,731
Because I know where
Ronnie Raymond is.

699
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:15,572
I know what really happened
to him that night.

700
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,141
And I know how to save him.

701
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,913
Warning! Tachyon output
has passed acceptable

702
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,315
tolerance range.

703
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,117
Continued exposure is not
recommended.

704
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,453
Increase to maximum, Gideon.

705
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,655
Increasing to maximum,
Doctor.

706
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,159
Speed Force absorption
at 35% and rising.

707
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm not stabilizing.
I can't hang on to my speed.

708
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,065
It comes and goes,
and I can not control it.

709
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:46,836
Gideon, for how much longer is
the Tachyonic device viable?

710
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,105
Calculations inconclusive.

711
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,642
I'm sorry, Doctor.
That's okay, Gideon.

712
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:56,179
This was only meant to be
a temporary fix.

713
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,315
The real endgame is almost here.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
