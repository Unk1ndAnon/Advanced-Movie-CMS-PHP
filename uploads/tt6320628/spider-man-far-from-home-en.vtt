1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,073
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,100
When I was a child, I saw my
mother killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:09,636
Run, Barry, run!

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,773
My father went to prison for her murder.

5
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:17,178
Then an accident made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,650
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,787
but secretly I use my speed

8
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,324
to fight crime and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:27,161
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:28,961
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:32,261
I am... The Flash.

12
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:34,262
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,062
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

14
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,163
But you really did see something
that night your mom died

15
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,933
and your dad is innocent.

16
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:43,241
The explosion that put you
in a coma also killed my fiance.

17
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,510
Can you imagine if
you could control his power?

18
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,812
If you could harness it,

19
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,347
you could change what it means to be human.

20
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,951
He's called The Flash.

21
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:54,493
Or, at least, he will be one day.

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,662
He must be kept safe.

23
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:04,773
It doesn't matter if you're the slowest kid

24
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:07,143
in gym class or the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:10,953
Every one of us is running.

26
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,256
Being alive means running...

27
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:13,824
running from something,

28
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:15,326
running to something

29
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,363
or someone.

30
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,267
And no matter how fast you are,

31
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,271
there's some things you can't outrun.

32
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:25,244
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

33
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,983
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

34
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:31,219
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four, tops.

35
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,889
There's a zombie movie scale?

36
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,262
Did you know that zombies exist in nature?

37
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:38,265
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

38
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,234
causing the ants to attack plants

39
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,537
that can release spores
which in turn infect new hosts.

40
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,004
I'm going full nerd again, aren't I?

41
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:45,138
- Yep.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,540
Yeah. It's okay though.

43
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,678
You are still the cutest nerd that I know.

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,447
Anyways, I'm a lot more interested

45
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:51,847
in the amazing as of late.

46
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,882
You mean 'cause of this “streak” thing?

47
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,719
He's out there.
People are talking about him.

48
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,054
How do you even know he's a he?

49
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,088
Maybe it's a she.

50
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,789
It's a man, okay?

51
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,060
You know I am really intuitive
about this kind of stuff.

52
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:03,362
Someone even posted a picture

53
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:04,996
after being yanked from a car accident.

54
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,731
It's a red blur leaving the scene.

55
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,202
Here, what do you see?

56
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,841
I see your boyfriend's calling.

57
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,277
Oh, I should probably get this.

58
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,947
I'm crashing at his place tonight,

59
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,884
and he's supposed to leave
a key for me somewhere.

60
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,585
Hey, babe. What's up?

61
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:23,122
Not much, just hanging out with Barry.

62
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,124
You off yet?

63
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,231
Hello.

64
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,500
Code 237 on Waid Boulevard.

65
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:32,303
Public indecency?

66
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,073
Wait, I think I meant a 239.

67
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,941
Dog leash violation?

68
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:38,643
Bad man with a gun in a getaway car.

69
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,311
Go.

70
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,047
You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

71
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,296
He's got a gun. Look out!

72
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:03,671
Where'd he go?

73
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,475
What the...

74
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:11,609
Key's in the mailbox.

75
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,281
I'll see you later. Bye.

76
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,182
- Eddie says hi.
- Nice of him.

77
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:17,516
You wanna grab a bite?

78
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,284
I'm feeling a little famished.

79
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:21,420
After the Mongolian barbecue
we had before the movie

80
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,356
and the extra large popcorn
you had at the movie?

81
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,692
How are you not fat?

82
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,796
I've been jogging.

83
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:30,065
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,671
Why so public a meeting, uncle?

85
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:40,174
We're dining out to show
our enemies we're not afraid.

86
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,808
Relax, nephew.

87
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,076
We've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

88
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,343
Close it up.

89
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:47,343
Come.

90
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:48,577
Have a drink.

91
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:04,490
Our own drivers are ripping us off.

92
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:07,195
Someone is paying them

93
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,930
to steal from us.

94
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:14,570
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

95
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,773
And then those thieves...

96
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:19,476
Those thieves...

97
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,946
Will draw

98
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,247
their last breath.

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,285
Uncle!

100

Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,865
- Where'd you cut him off?
- So we cut him off at eighth.

102
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,262
I mean, the perp was in
the backseat of the cruiser

103
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,761
before he even knew what happened.

104
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:53,928
Congratulations, Paulson,

105
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,331
on that arrest last night.

106
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,034
- Hell of a job.
- You come by later, Joe.

107
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:59,702
I'll give you a driving lesson, okay?

108
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,804
Wasn't even him last night. It was me.

109
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:02,938
I figured.

110
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,206
I just didn't realize

111
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,806
you were helping people for the glory.

112
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,474
It's not like I want a
museum built in my name.

113
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,142
Keeping what I can do a secret
from Iris and everyone,

114
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,410
it's harder than I thought.

115
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,312
I know, but it is safer that way.

116
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,316
Besides, me and you got work to do.

117
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,756
The evidence from my mom's case.

118
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:23,457
I had it brought up from storage.

119
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,390
I've been through this box 1,000 times.

120
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:29,129
Before, your story about what
really happened that night...

121
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:31,200
the lightning storm,
the man in the middle of it...

122
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:32,533
I thought that was a kid

123
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,334
trying to protect his father from prison.

124
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,904
But now that I know it's true,

125
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:38,744
we're gonna go through
every scrap of evidence

126
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,312
until we find something that helps us.

127
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:42,381
It took the jury 52 minutes to come back

128
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,650
with a verdict of guilty.

129
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,618
They moved too fast,

130
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,685
which is why we got to take our time.

131
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:52,158
Barry, Joe, we got multiple homicides.

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,892
Do you know the Darbinyan crime family?

133
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,166
Bay?

134
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,369
Ah. Anything?

135
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:08,805
Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

136
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,776
The cells in their bodies
were unable to utilize oxygen.

137
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,244
It's consistent with
exposure to poison gas.

138
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,577
What kind of poison?

139
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,010
I'll need to take a lung sample,

140
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,746
see if I can narrow it down.

141
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:22,183
The only other exit was
bolted from the inside.

142
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,782
They were trapped.

143
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,184
I was thinking someone
pumped gas in from the outside,

144
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,719
but witnesses say the street was empty.

145
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,287
So it was from the inside.

146
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,022
That means there should be a canister

147
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,992
or a container left behind.

148
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,228
The gas just didn't come in by itself.

149
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,563
Unless it had a mind of its own.

150
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,535
Eddie, would you mind canvassing again?

151
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,404
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

152
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,206
Okay, explain.

153
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,875
The boss collapsed by the table.

154
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,678
This guy made it 10 feet away.

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,180
That guy had a chance to move off

156
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,615
and fire three shots into the window

157
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,950
trying to break the glass.

158
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,118
But they all started in the same spot,

159
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

160
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,123
at the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

161
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,892
They were attacked one by one.

162
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:12,359
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

163
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,094
you and me are gonna need...

164
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:17,597
- Backup.
- Yeah.

165
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,300
Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

166
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,669
Is it just poisonous gas,

167
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,337
or can he control all aerated substances?

168
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,472
And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

169
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,441
Is it physiological or psychological?

170
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,808
This individual can create

171
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,476
a mental nexus using gaseous substances.

172
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,478
You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

173
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,979
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

174
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,715
They get really excited about this stuff.

175
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,016
The only thing I'm excited about

176
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:38,819
is putting criminals behind bars.

177
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,489
Except Iron Heights isn't exactly equipped

178
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,025
to handle meta-humans.

179
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,661
Then I guess it's fortunate the ones

180
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,196
you've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

181
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,232
Well, unless we're planning on executing

182
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,469
every super criminal we stop,

183
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,041
you geniuses are gonna have to come up

184
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,942
with someplace else to hold them.

185
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,911
A meta-human prison. Sweet.

186
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:59,681
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

187
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:04,352
There is one place here
that might hold them.

188
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,751
You can't be serious.

189
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,455
I mean, we haven't been down there since...

190
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:09,790
it's cordoned off.

191
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,789
Cisco is right.

192
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,789
It could be modified to act

193
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,956
as a makeshift prison.

194
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,024
What could?

195
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,860
The particle accelerator.

196
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:24,267
Tonight, the future begins.

197
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,538
The work my team and I will do here

198
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,076
will change our understanding of physics,

199
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,312
will bring about advancements in power,

200
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,479
advancements in medicine.

201
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,347
And trust me, that future

202
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,083
will be here faster than you think.

203
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,419
Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

204
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,921
A big thunderstorm is rolling in.

205
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,490
We're not launching a space shuttle.

206
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:48,226
We'll be fine.

207
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,696
Tahiti?

208
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,265
I know it's a long flight, Ronnie,

209
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,301
but we can binge watch
Orange Is The New Black.

210
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:54,534
Oh, okay.

211
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,371
But what about Italy?

212
00:08:56,373 --> 00:09:00,309
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

213
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:02,946
Yes, but Italy doesn't have mai tais,

214
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:04,684
and a honeymoon isn't a honeymoon

215
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,352
without nai tais.

216
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,321
Dr. Wells, the accelerator is primed

217
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:09,891
and ready for particle injection.

218
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:13,760
Well, I feel I should
say something profound

219
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:18,432
like “one small step for man,”

220
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,699
but all I can think of to say is,

221
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,203
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

222
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:35,706
That's it?

223
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,040
You'd think there'd be, like, a loud bang.

224
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,110
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

225
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,177
Take it from the guy who helped build it.

226
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:45,549
Ladies and gentlemen, we did it.

227
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,559
Mai tais it is.

228
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:10,543
Was that...

229
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:14,482
A loud bang.

230
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,519
Caitlin.

231
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,855
Caitlin.

232
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,458
Did you hear me?

233
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,360
We're going down to the accelerator ring.

234
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:25,628
Actually, Dr. Wells,
I could use Caitlin's help

235
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,598
identifying the poison gas.

236
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,932
Okay.

237
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,333
If that's okay with you?

238
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,002
Let's go.

239
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,173
Welcome to the CCPD.

240
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:47,467
So this is your day job.

241
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:48,902
Mm-hmm.

242
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,069
I'm gonna rip out your hearts

243
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,638
and eat 'em for lunch.

244
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,040
Delightful.

245
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:56,441
Lab rat, I need prints off this gun pronto.

246
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:58,177
Allen!

247
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,346
Where the hell is the fiber
analysis on the Orloff case?

248
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,817
Upstairs. It's all finished.

249
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,352
I can just run up and bring it down.

250
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,087
With you, that could be
three days from now.

251
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,790
I'll go with you. Who are you?

252
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,660
Dr. Caitlin Snow,

253
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,693
Barry's personal physician.

254
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:17,633
The fiber analysis for the Orloff case,

255
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,200
like you asked for,

256
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:21,267
sir.

257
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,807
Clean up your lab.

258
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,442
It's a mess.

259
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:34,115
The lightning was in the house.

260
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,417
I told my son to run,

261
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,253
he disappeared,

262
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:39,755
and that's when I saw the blood.

263
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:41,423
Your prints were on the murder weapon.

264
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,094
I needed to stabilize the knife.

265
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:45,827
I'm a doctor.

266
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:48,596
I was trying to save her.

267
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:49,932
I didn't kill my wife.

268
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:52,601
Joe, tell them.

269
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:54,502
You know me. Our kids are friends.

270
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,170
You tell them, Joe.

271
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:01,078
Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

272
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,779
It's just work.

273
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:06,550
Some old cases weren't filed properly.

274
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,326
Detective. What are you doing here?

275
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:18,827
Joe, I thought you were at the morgue.

276
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,033
I decided to bring some work home.

277
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,701
Why are you here?

278
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:28,137
Yes, well, I've been looking for you.

279
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,107
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

280
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:33,176
re-canvass, see if we missed anything.

281
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,577
Always work the case, right?

282
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,178
That's what you taught me.

283
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,515
Wow, you've been listening.

284
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,350
Okay, let's hit it.

285
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,252
You mind if I use your bathroom?

286
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,852
It's the first door on the right.

287
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:46,056
I'll be in the car.

288
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,560
Bye, baby.

289
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:49,095
Bye, dad.

290
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,001
Okay, this has got to stop.

291
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,701
I came here to surprise my girlfriend,

292
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,172
and now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad...

293
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,944
not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

294
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,311
I know, I know, it's just...

295
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,744
it's not the right time to tell him.

296
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:06,046
When is, Iris?

297
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,580
I know my dad. He'll kill us.

298
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,680
Right now, you're killing us.

299
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,618
The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

300
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,358
and we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

301
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,261
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

302
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:40,131
meta-human abilities, but...

303
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,199
might just work.

304
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,368
First, we have to decouple
the main injection system

305
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,369
on the gantry level.

306
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,606
I'll be right back.

307
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,343
Why don't I do that?

308
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,145
I need the exercise.

309
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,751
There's an anomaly in the core chamber.

310
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,652
The ring's structural integrity is holding.

311
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,153
It's started a chain reaction.

312
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,054
The system is collapsing.
We need to shut it down.

313
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,522
We can't ramp down
the accelerator from here.

314
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,855
- We need to do it manually.
- Go.

315
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,157
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

316
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,526
I'm the lead engineer.

317
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,195
I know how to operate the shutdown valve.

318
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:15,300
- It's not safe.
- Cait, I have to go.

319
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,413
Okay, you stay here.

320
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,484
We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows,

321
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:29,718
and if I'm not back in time,
you need to initiate lockdown.

322
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,552
No way. I am not closing this door.

323
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,020
I won't be able to open it again.

324
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,589
Cisco, if you don't seal off the blast,

325
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,158
everyone in this building will die,

326
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,594
including Caitlin.

327
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:40,196
Okay, now promise me.

328
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:44,664
Set your watch.

329
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,865
Two minutes.

330
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:52,271
You're coming back.

331
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,667
Cisco.

332
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,703
Cisco, we're ready to go.

333
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:26,941
Must be hard, coming back down here.

334
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,943
A lot happened that night.

335
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:30,178
If you feel the need to talk...

336
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,080
I was just thinking,

337
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:34,350
we need to nail those voltage calculations.

338
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,451
One fault, and the helium blowback

339
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,355
could damage the mountings.

340
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,421
Smart.

341
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:49,830
Can I ask you something

342
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,332
that you don't have to answer?

343
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,568
My least favorite kind of question.

344
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,904
Shoot.

345
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:00,441
Ronnie. What was he like?

346
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:04,580
You just never talk about him that much.

347
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:07,717
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

348
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:10,052
He was the structural engineer.

349
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,552
He liked to joke that he was basically

350
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,787
a very high-priced plumber.

351
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,992
We were very different.

352
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:21,592
You might have noticed I can be a bit...

353
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,294
Guarded.

354
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,365
Ronnie knew how to make me laugh.

355
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:29,602
He used to say we were like fire and ice.

356
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:36,506
He wasn't supposed to be there that night.

357
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:38,873
He was just there for me.

358
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,107
If he hadn't...

359
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,214
This says that there was
no residue of gas in the tissue,

360
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,084
poisonous or otherwise.

361
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:52,251
It must have evaporated.

362
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:53,586
We'll need to get a fresh sample.

363
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,554
Wait, this can't be right.

364
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,555
This says that there are
two distinct strands of DNA

365
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:00,825
inside the tissue.

366
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:03,728
How did someone else's DNA
get inside the victim's lungs?

367
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,075
Well, my docket was clear,
so I stopped by the mall

368
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,511
to pick up your homecoming dress.

369
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:15,082
I am a great mom.

370
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,087
I'll see you for dinner, sweetie.

371
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:24,330
There's no DNA match in the database.

372
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,599
I don't understand.

373
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,334
Why would a chemical attack

374
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:31,902
leave behind another person's
DNA inside the victim?

375
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,606
What if the meta-human we're looking for

376
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,809
doesn't control gas?

377
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:38,010
What if he becomes it?

378
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,288
Judge Howard.

379
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,987
It's nice to see you again.

380
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:56,455
You died.

381
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,590
You say that like it was an accident.

382
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,292
You remember the last thing you said to me

383
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:02,793
in the courtroom?

384
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:07,399
May God have mercy on your soul.

385
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,511
All available units, we have a report

386
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,778
of a toxic gas attack

387
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,246
in the central city shopping mall.

388
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:26,278
Barry, don't.

389
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,851
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

390
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,085
It's not safe.

391
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,718
Caitlin, I have to go.

392
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:50,421
I patched into the mall's security system.

393
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:52,022
According to witnesses, the gas attack

394
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:54,092
was in the main elevator in the north wing.

395
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,362
Which one is the north wing?

396
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:59,063
The one with The Big Belly Burger.

397
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,831
I eat.

398
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,468
Back up. Please, keep back.

399
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:24,148
Why did you kill that woman?

400
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,786
She deserved to die.

401
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,087
Now go run away.

402
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:38,523
I still have one more name on my list.

403
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,663
Don't make me add you to it.

404
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:05,885
Barry.

405
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:07,488
Barry, can you hear me?

406
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,489
His vitals are weak,
but he's alive, Dr. Wells.

407
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,795
I'm sure he's fine.

408
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:14,632
I can't breathe.

409
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:17,900
He needs oxygen. Get the crash cart!

410
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:23,675
Barry!

411
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,510
- Barry.
- Cut me open.

412
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,811
The poison's still in me.
He brought us a sample.

413
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,080
Caitlin, we need to do a pulmonary biopsy,

414
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,648
extract an active portion of that gas.

415
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,116
I can't give you any anesthetic.

416
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:34,918
Your metabolism will burn right through it.

417
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I heal quick, remember?

418
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,155
Do it.

419
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,323
Cisco, give me the syringe.

420
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,459
This is gonna hurt a lot.

421
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,527
It's a small needle.
You probably won't even feel it.

422
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,928
You're definitely going to feel it.

423
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,473
The Streak lives.

424
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,773
You'd be dead if your lung cells

425
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,207
didn't regenerate so quickly.

426
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,177
My chest feels like that one time

427
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,815
I had a cigarette.

428
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,517
Yeah, teen me lived for danger.

429
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,951
This isn't funny. You could've...

430
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:11,051
I didn't.

431
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,191
Now that we have a sample,
we'll get to work analyzing it,

432
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,693
figure out the makeup of the poison,

433
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,862
maybe get a clue as to his human identity.

434
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,067
Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

435
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:24,071
The Mist. Okay, that's his name.

436
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,407
End of discussion.

437
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,811
I have to get to the station.

438
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:28,447
You should be resting.

439
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,984
I have to talk to Joe.

440
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,461
Joe. I had him.

441
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,095
The meta-human. We were wrong.

442
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,965
He's not controlling airborne toxins.

443
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,804
He can literally transform
himself into poison gas.

444
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:45,771
That's new.

445
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,339
The victim was a judge.

446
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,042
We're going through some of her old cases

447
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:50,311
to see if there's a connection.

448
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:52,578
It's too late.

449
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,013
I should have been faster.

450
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,548
Focus on the job.

451
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,283
Don't think about that right now.

452
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,783
You don't want to know
what I'm thinking about.

453
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,694
My dad has spent 14 years

454
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:13,602
in a 6x8-foot cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

455
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:15,937
I couldn't save my mom, but I can save him.

456
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:17,503
Didn't I promise you

457
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,206
that we would get your father
out of prison together?

458
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,612
I don't need your help, Joe.

459
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:25,214
I could be in and out of there with him

460
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:28,922
before anyone even sees me.

461
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,859
Okay.

462
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,795
You break him out of there.

463
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,298
Then what?

464
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,269
He's on the run for the rest of his life.

465
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,507
And something tell me
he's not as fast as you are.

466
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:43,008
You don't know what it's like there.

467
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,577
You think I don't understand

468
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,412
what you're feeling?

469
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:48,748
I have been a cop for almost as long

470
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,584
as you've been alive.

471
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,320
So you should know, putting on that suit

472
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:54,420
does not make everybody safe.

473
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:55,856
For every person you save,

474
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,526
there's gonna be somebody you can't.

475
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,363
And the hardest thing
you're gonna have to face

476
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,332
is not some monster out there with powers.

477
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:03,866
It's gonna be that feeling of uselessness

478
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:07,135
when you can't do anything.

479
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:16,647
Or the guilt that weighs on you
when you make a mistake.

480
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:27,298
Some things, Barry, you can't fight.

481
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,070
Some things you just have to live with.

482
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,602
Yes, I'm writing this down.

483
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:54,471
Red streak at the mall

484
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:56,640
during the gas attack.

485
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:59,877
Thank you for calling.

486
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,478
Never fails.

487
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,580
Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

488
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:05,716
Did they get a good look
at the Streak's face?

489
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:09,450
Not you too.

490
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:12,621
What are you doing here anyway?

491
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:15,157
We need to talk.

492
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:18,525
I thought about what you said, and...

493
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,561
I know what you're gonna say.

494
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,831
I understand.

495
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,165
I'm your dad's partner.

496
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,432
No, no, no, you don't understand.

497
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:29,367
I have never really had
a serious boyfriend.

498
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,770
Between dad and Barry and work,

499
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,405
my life has been full.

500
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:36,708
And I really like you,

501
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,843
but I thought that if I told
my dad about us,

502
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,611
then it would make this real,

503
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:43,478
and suddenly, it's something
that I could lose

504
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,284
or screw up.

505
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,786
I wanted it to be real.

506
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,189
Eddie.

507
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:19,624
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:21,960
I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

509
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:24,563
It's okay. I get it.

510
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:28,198
You had to go.

511
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,136
It's just...

512
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,638
that's the last thing that
Ronnie said to me that night.

513
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:43,614
My mother died 14 years ago.

514
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,686
I used to think that
the further away I got from it,

515
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:53,194
the less it would hurt.

516
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:56,632
But some days, the pain,

517
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:00,935
it's worse than the day that it happened.

518
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:02,972
Some things you can't fight.

519
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:09,178
For so long,

520
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,384
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

521
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,822
What if I went with you?

522
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,405
Where's Ronnie? Cisco, where is he?

523
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:35,610
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

524
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,412
I can't. We're in lockdown mode.

525
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:39,414
Cisco, we have to get him
out of there or he'll die.

526
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:42,082
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

527
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,693
Caitlin.

528
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:51,897
Is Cisco there?

529
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:53,866
Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here. I'm listening.

530
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:56,170
I adjusted the magnets to redirect the beam

531
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:57,505
to try and vent the system

532
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,575
so the blast goes up and not out.

533
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,511
I'll need to reset the particle parameters

534
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:03,580
to compensate.

535
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,881
Cisco's doing it.

536
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:07,517
There has to be another way out of there.

537
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,787
You have to find it.

538
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:13,757
Cait, the chain reaction,

539
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,759
I can't reverse it.

540
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:21,064
The doors need to stay shut to protect you.

541
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,297
You still there?

542
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:23,731
I'm here.

543
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,607
Caitlin, whatever happens...

544
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,607
Ronnie.

545
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:36,242
Ronnie!

546
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:45,489
He saved so many lives that day,

547
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:48,258
and no one will ever know what he did.

548
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:56,530
I do.

549
00:27:56,532 --> 00:28:00,068
He was a hero.

550
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,505
I didn't want him to be a hero.

551
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:05,608
I wanted him to be my husband.

552
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,418
Barry, Caitlin, you down there?

553
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,454
You got to come look at this.

554
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,591
Hey, check this out.

555
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:24,661
It's a 3D molecular model of the gas

556
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,931
we retrieved from your lungs.

557
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,667
We have identified the toxin.

558
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,336
Hydrogen cyanide?

559
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:32,105
What's interesting is what's mixed in

560
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:35,909
with the cyanide... A sedative.

561
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,710
Of course.

562
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:40,380
The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

563
00:28:40,382 --> 00:28:41,882
Why?

564
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:43,817
That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

565
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:45,218
before they go to the gas chamber

566
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,487
and breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

567
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,722
That's right.

568
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,057
There was someone executed.

569
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,658
- Kyle Nimbus.
- That's him.

570
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,160
He was a hit man for
the Darbinyan crime family.

571
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,029
They turned on him and testified.

572
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,966
Judge Theresa Howard
was the judge at his trial.

573
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,034
She sentenced him to death.

574
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:00,369
He must have been affected

575
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,404
by the explosion while he was being gassed.

576
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,675
Records indicate
the execution was completed.

577
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,245
That's why there wasn't a match.

578
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,180
The DNA database only has
records of the living.

579
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:09,681
Right.

580
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,549
He said there was
one more person on his list.

581
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,485
Check the arrest record. Who caught him?

582
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:15,121
That could be his next attack.

583
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:18,491
Barry, the lead detective...

584
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:27,399
Here to see Henry Allen.

585
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,733
Sign here.

586
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:30,068
Personal effects here.

587
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:51,455
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

588
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,889
Hey, do you know where Joe went?

589
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,190
He's not picking up his cell.

590
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,060
Uh, not sure.

591
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,830
Eddie, it's really important
I speak to him.

592
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,398
I need to know where he went.

593
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,366
He went to Iron Heights to see your dad.

594
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:06,938
Barry.

595
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,339
I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

596
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,240
I hope you won't need it.

597
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,625
What are you doing here?
Is Barry all right?

598
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:35,294
He's fine.

599
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:41,031
Then to what do I owe this visit?

600
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,702
I know I should have
come to see you sooner.

601
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:46,103
You just weren't up for a little chitchat

602
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:49,340
with a man who murdered his wife
in front of his own son?

603
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:52,842
Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

604
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,549
Barry, I pulled up the specs
on Iron Heights Prison.

605
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:03,150
It's maximum security,

606
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,349
but I think I can talk you
through breaking in there.

607
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,317
Don't bother.

608
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,319
I've been figuring out

609
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,421
how to break into that place

610
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:11,157
since I was 11.

611
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,260
Some new evidence has come to light.

612
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,432
I can't go into detail.

613
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,500
It's just...

614
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,868
Look, the important thing is,

615
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,237
I'm reopening the case.

616
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,440
I'm gonna find out who really killed Nora,

617
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:28,706
and I promise you, Henry,

618
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,610
I'm going to get you out of here.

619
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:35,917
I am so sorry.

620
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,890
It doesn't matter that
you didn't believe in me...

621
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:44,065
Because you always believed in my son.

622
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,918
Nimbus.

623
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,221
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Same to you.

624
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:19,364
Joe?

625
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,298
Joe!

626
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,332
Help!

627
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,866
Guards!

628
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,132
Somebody help!

629
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,300
Go get him.

630
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:07,948
So you've come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

631
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,487
You're going somewhere you
can't hurt anyone ever again.

632
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,758
Wrong.

633
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,501
He used the antidote on Joe.

634
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,603
You need to stay away from him, Barry.

635
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,138
Do not breathe him in.

636
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,347
I'm not sure how that helps me, guys.

637
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,494
You can't fight him, Barry.

638
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,228
Just keep him coming at you.

639
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,559
That should sap his strength.

640
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,761
Gas is the least stable form of matter.

641
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:57,929
This meta-human will not be able

642
00:33:57,931 --> 00:33:59,298
to stay in his mist form for long.

643
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,068
His particles will need to reform.

644
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,402
Barry.

645
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:07,176
Barry.

646
00:35:07,178 --> 00:35:08,878
We win.

647
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:26,274
It's been a while
since I watched you sleep.

648
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:33,883
Rescuing you is exhausting.

649
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:36,116
I really miss the ability

650
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:38,150
to be able to ground you.

651
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,989
Sorry I went and grew up.

652
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:48,566
I could have got my dad
out of Iron Heights tonight.

653
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:51,569
I know.

654
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:52,838
But you were right.

655
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,838
That's not the way.

656
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,105
- Daddy.
- Oh.

657
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:58,909
Baby, I'm fine. Don't worry.

658
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,153
I'll let you guys talk.

659
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:09,957
Partner.

660
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,758
You two arrive at the same time?

661
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,354
Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

662
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,523
Dad, the thing is...

663
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:25,493
you two are dating.

664
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,025
- I know.
- You do?

665
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:30,125
I'm a detective, remember?

666
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:34,094
And both of you are lousy liars.

667
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,328
So you're not mad?

668
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,298
Oh, I'm mad.

669
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,268
And if the doctor
hadn't confiscated my gun,

670
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,737
we'd be having an entirely
different conversation.

671
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,306
Well, I should let you two talk,

672
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:48,074
and I'll just be outside

673
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:50,643
looking into the witness
protection program.

674
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:54,887
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,759
Iris, this is going to be complicated.

676
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:00,532
You know I don't like complicated.

677
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:05,673
Do you like him?

678
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,810
Yeah, I do.

679
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:10,080
Then I will do my damnedest
not to shoot him.

680
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:12,346
That is all I ask.

681
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:21,029
Will it hold?

682
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,431
The barrier is powered by

683
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:25,267
an 8.3 Tesla superconducting electromagnet,

684
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:27,937
which is about 100,000 times the strength

685
00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:30,570
of earth's magnetic field.

686
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:33,208
In other words, yes.

687
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:37,716
Hmm. He's mad.

688
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,622
Well, good night.

689
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,633
So we're just supposed to get used to

690
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,837
working above a makeshift prison

691
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:54,241
housing evil people with superpowers.

692
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,944
You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, Caitlin.

693
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,652
Caitlin.

694
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:06,421
Could I talk to you for a second?

695
00:38:06,423 --> 00:38:09,493
Sure. What's up?

696
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,862
It's about the night that Ronnie died.

697
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:15,834
I...

698
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:20,038
look, Cisco, I'm okay.

699
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,073
I thought coming down here would undo me,

700
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:27,810
but thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

701
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,549
It just made me love him more.

702
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:37,957
Come on.

703
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,892
I need ice cream or a drink.

704
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:41,960
Let's see which one we hit first.

705
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:52,736
Joe's gonna be okay.

706
00:38:57,642 --> 00:39:01,347
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

707
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:03,748
A lot.

708
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,949
I miss her.

709
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:11,281
Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

710
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:15,416
A couple times.

711
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:17,149
Everyone was walking before you.

712
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:19,415
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

713
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:21,046
not you.

714
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,180
But your mom was never worried.

715
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,515
She just said, “he'll walk

716
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:29,084
when he has someplace to go.”

717
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:32,087
and sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

718
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:37,060
you moved so quick, you didn't just walk,

719
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:38,060
you started...

720
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:41,628
To run.

721
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,401
And you ran to your mom, Barry.

722
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:49,007
Right into her arms.

723
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,212
You had someplace to go.

724
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:06,587
I thought being the fastest man alive

725
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,653
would make my life easier...

726
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,857
that I could outrun anything.

727
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:16,629
Turns out, no one can outrun pain.

728
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,331
Somebody help! Please, somebody!

729
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,799
Life is tragic.

730
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,915
But it's also precious...

731
00:40:29,854 --> 00:40:31,289
And sweet...

732
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,796
And extraordinary.

733
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:47,237
And the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

734
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,438
is to keep running.

735
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:11,056
Dr. Wells.

736
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,624
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.

737
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:13,990
He vented the system.

738
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:15,457
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

739
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,593
Good man.

740
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:19,163
I'm on my way down.

741
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:59,503
See you soon, Barry.
